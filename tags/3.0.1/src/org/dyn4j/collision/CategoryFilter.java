/**
 * {@link Filter} for categorized objects.
 * <p>
 * Constructing a {@link CategoryFilter#CategoryFilter(int, int)} requires supplying
 * two integers: a category integer and a mask integer.
 * <p>
 * The usage of this class can be explained below:
 * <pre> CategoryFilter f1 = new CategoryFilter(1, 1);
 * CategoryFilter f2 = new CategoryFilter(2, 2);
 * CategoryFilter f3 = new CategoryFitler(3, 3);
 * 
 * f1.isAllowed(f2); // returns false
 * f2.isAllowed(f3); // returns true?!</pre>
 * This is because the integers passed in are being used via their binary representation.
 * If we examine the binary representation of these numbers:
 * <pre> 1 = 0...0001
 * 2 = 0...0010
 * 3 = 0...0011</pre>
 * We see that 3 is actually a combination of 1 and 2.  Because of this <code>f3</code>
 * will actually be part of category 1 and 2, not its own category.
 * <p>
 * Because of this representation there are a maximum of 32 categories that can be
 * represented:
 * <pre> category  1 =  1 = 2^0
 * category  2 =  2 = 2^1
 * category  3 =  4 = 2^2
 * category  4 =  8 = 2^3
 * category  5 = 16 = 2^4
 * ...
 * category 32 = Integer.MAX_VALUE = 2^32</pre>
 * In addition, the mask integer is handled in a similar way.  <code>f3</code> will be able to
 * collision with both category 1 and 2 because of the binary representation of 3.
 * <p>
 * In general, the mask or category can be generated by OR-ing the categories.
 * For example:
 * <pre> final int CATEGORY_0 = 1;
 * final int CATEGORY_1 = 2;
 * final int CATEGORY_2 = 4;
 * final int MASK_ALL = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
 * 
 * // make f1 part of category 0, and allow collisions with category 0 and 1
 * CategoryFilter f1 = new CategoryFilter(CATEGORY_0, CATEGORY_0 | CATEGORY_1);
 * 
 * // make f2 part of category 1 and 2, and allow collisions with category 0 and 2
 * CategoryFilter f2 = new CategoryFilter(CATEGORY_1 | CATEGORY_2, CATEGORY_0 | CATEGORY_2);
 * 
 * // make f3 part of category 2, and allow collision with every category
 * CategoryFilter f3 = new CategoryFilter(CATEGORY_2, MASK_ALL);
 * 
 * f1.isAllowed(f2); // returns true since f1 can collide with 0 or 1 and f2 is part of 1
 *                   // and because f2 can collide with 0 or 2 and f1 is part of 0
 *                   
 * f1.isAllowed(f3); // returns false since f1 can collide with 0 or 1 but f3 is part of 2 only
 *                   // even though f3 is allowed to collide with all categories (both must work)
 *                   
 * f2.isAllowed(f3); // returns true since f2 can collide with 0 or 2 and f3 is part of 2
 *                   // and because f3 can collide with all categories</pre>
 * As its apparent from the code above, both f1.isAllowed(f2) and f2.isAllowed(f1) must return true
 * if the entire result is to be deemed true.
 * <p>
 * By default the {@link CategoryFilter} will be set to category 1 and
 * have a mask of all category bits.
 * <p>
 * Basically the filter from <a href="http://www.box2d.org">Box2d</a>.
