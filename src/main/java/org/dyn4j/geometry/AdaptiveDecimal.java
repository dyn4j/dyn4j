/**
 * This is an implementation of multi-precision decimals based on the original work by Jonathan Richard Shewchuk,
 * "Routines for Arbitrary Precision Floating-point Arithmetic and Fast Robust Geometric Predicates".
 * <p>

 * Short description:
 * The value of this {@link AdaptiveDecimal} is represented as the sum of some components,
 * where each component is a double value.
 * The components must be stored in increasing magnitude order, but there can be any amount of
 * zeros between components. The components must also satisfy the non-overlapping property, that is
 * the corresponding bit representation of adjacent components must not overlap. See {@link #checkInvariants()}
 * and the corresponding paper for more info.
 * <p>
 * This code <b>requires</b> that the floating point model is IEEE-754 with round-to-even in order
 * to work properly in all cases and fulfill the above properties. This is not a problem because this
 * is the default and only model the Java specification describes.
