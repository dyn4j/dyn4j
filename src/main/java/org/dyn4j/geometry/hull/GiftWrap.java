/**
 * Implementation of the Gift Wrapping convex hull algorithm.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm handles coincident and colinear points by ignoring them during processing. This ensures
 * the produced hull will not have coincident or colinear vertices.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm is O(nh) worst case where n is the number of points and h is the
 * number of sides in the resulting convex hull.
