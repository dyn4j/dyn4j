/**
 * This package contains algorithms used to create convex hulls of point clouds.
 * <p>
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.hull.HullGenerator} four different implementations:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.dyn4j.geometry.hull.GiftWrap}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.dyn4j.geometry.hull.GrahamScan}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.dyn4j.geometry.hull.MonotoneChain}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.dyn4j.geometry.hull.DivideAndConquer}</li>
 * </ul>
 * The hulls are returned as {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Vector2}[]s that can then be used to create a 
 * {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Convex} {@link org.dyn4j.geometry.Shape}.
 * <p>
 * Algorithms implementing this interface are intended for general use but does not imply that
 * the results produced would be appropriate for the core dyn4j engine.
 * <p>
 * All algorithms should produce a valid convex hull that encapsulates all the given points, but there's
 * no guarantee that the algorithms produce identical results.
 * @author William Bittle 
 * @version 3.4.0
 * @since 2.2.0
