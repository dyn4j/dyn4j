/**
 * Represents a broad-phase collision detection algorithm.
 * <p>
 * A {@link BroadphaseDetector} should quickly determine the pairs of {@link CollisionBody}s and 
 * {@link Fixture}s that possibly intersect.  These algorithms are used to filter out collision 
 * pairs in the interest of sending less pairs to the {@link NarrowphaseDetector} which is generally
 * much more expensive.
 * <p>
 * {@link BroadphaseDetector}s require that the bodies are updated via the {@link #update(CollisionBody)}
 * or {@link #update(CollisionBody, Fixture)} methods when the bodies move, rotate, or have their shape
 * changed in anyway.
 * <p>
 * <b>
 * NOTE: Special care must be taken when removing fixtures from a body.  Be sure to call the 
 * {@link #remove(CollisionBody, Fixture)} method to make sure its removed from the broad-phase.
 * </b>
 * <p>
 * Some {@link BroadphaseDetector}s use a expansion value to expand a body's AABB width and height.  The 
 * {@link #getAABB(CollisionBody)} returns the expanded {@link AABB}.  This expansion is used to reduce the 
 * number of updates to the broad-phase.  See the {@link #setAABBExpansion(double)} for more details on 
 * this value.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #detect()}, {@link #detect(AABB)}, {@link #raycast(Ray, double)} methods and their Iterator 
 * counterpart methods use the current state of all the bodies and fixtures that have been added.  Make 
 * sure that all changes have been reflected to the broad-phase using the {@link #update(CollisionBody)} and 
 * {@link #update(CollisionBody, Fixture)} methods before calling these.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #detect(Convex, Transform, Convex, Transform)} method does not use the current state of the broad-phase,
 * but the {@link #detect(CollisionBody, CollisionBody)} does.
