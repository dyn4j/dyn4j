	 * The deltaPosition and deltaAngle parameters define the cast of the convex. Imagine moving
	 * the given convex from it's current transform position to the given position and rotating
	 * the given convex from it's current transform rotation to the given rotation. This method detects
	 * if there was any collisions between these start and end states.
	 * <p>
	 * This method assumes linear motion, meaning that the direction of motion is in the same direction
	 * for the start and end states as defined by the deltaPosition parameter.
	 * @param convex the convex
