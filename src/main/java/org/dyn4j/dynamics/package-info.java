/**
 * Package containing classes that handle physical interaction.
 * <p>
 * There are three constructs that this and sub packages handle:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Physical Bodies</li>
 * <li>Contacts</li>
 * <li>Joints</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Physical Bodies</b>
 * <p>
 * Physical bodies are respresented by the {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.PhysicsBody}
 * interface and the {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.Body} class. These add the concepts
 * of velocity, force, impulse, etc. to the {@link org.dyn4j.collision.CollisionBody}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Contacts</b>
 * <p>
 * Contacts are represented by the {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.contact.Contact} interface
 * and the {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.contact.ContactConstraint} class. Together these
 * define contact between two {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.PhysicsBody}s that needs to be
 * resolved. The {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.contact.ContactConstraintSolver} defines the
 * process to solve a set of contacts.
 * <p>
 * <b>Joints</b>
 * <p>
 * Joints are rules placed between two {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.PhysicsBody}s that 
 * governs their motion. For example the {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.joint.DistanceJoint}
 * is used to keep two {@link org.dyn4j.dynamics.PhysicsBody}s within some distance
 * of each other.
